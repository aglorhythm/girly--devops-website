# Hi there ðŸŒ¸

This is the repository of girlysheet.cloud website ! I made it public so you can observe how I manage to deploy my infrastructure.

But wait ..

The CDN is not up to date yet ! You can still access the website and, below, you will find the architecture of this project.

## Architecture ðŸŒ¼

### Frontend

- **AWS** (Amazon Web Services)
    - **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Serves as the dynamic web hosting service, providing scalable compute capacity.
    - **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Used for storing infrastructure state.
    - **CloudFront**: Implemented as a CDN (Content Delivery Network), CloudFront speeds up the delivery of content by caching static resources closer to users.

### Backend

- **OVH** : Provides hosting for WordPress, enabling easy content management and backend updates without direct modifications to backend code.

### DevOps

- **Azure** :
    - **Repos**: Manages source code using Azure Repos, offering secure version control.
    - **Pipelines**: Automates builds and deployments using Azure Pipelines, ensuring smooth and continuous integration and deployment processes.
    - **Container Registry**: Hosts Docker container image of the frontend that is used in deployments, supporting consistent and reproducible builds.

### Database

- **Azure MySQL** : The primary database used by the website, storing all dynamic data and user information securely and efficiently.
